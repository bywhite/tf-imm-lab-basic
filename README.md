# tf-imm-lab-basic


This repo contains basic labs for working with Intersight and Terraform.
It is recommended to create a new Intersight Organization for the lab and
substitute the new <org-name> for the "default" org used in this code.

  Instructions for each lab moduel are in-line in the "main.tf" file
  for each lab module.
